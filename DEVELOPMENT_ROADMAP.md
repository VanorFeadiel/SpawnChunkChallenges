---

## Phase 8: New Challenge Types üéÆ POST-RELEASE
**Goal**: Add Resource and Kitchen Sink challenges

### Resource Challenge
**Concept**: Turn in specific resources to gain points for unlock

**Implementation Ideas:**
- Trash can placed near spawn (empty tile check)
- Destroy items in trash can to count them
- Point system: different items = different values
- Track cumulative points per chunk
- Foundation for PZ Tycoon mode

**Technical Considerations:**
- Item tracking (OnObjectAdded/OnObjectRemoved events)
- Trash can spawning logic (find empty tile)
- Point value configuration (Sandbox options)
- Visual feedback (item count, point progress)

### Kitchen Sink Challenge
**Concept**: Complete ALL requirements to unlock chunk

**Requirements:**
- Kill X zombies AND
- Spend X hours AND  
- Level up X skills AND
- Collect X resource points

**Special Rule**: When all skills are maxed (level 10), skill requirement disappears

**Technical Considerations:**
- Multi-condition tracking
- Progressive difficulty (requirements scale with chunks unlocked)
- UI showing all progress bars
- Configuration options for each requirement type

### Testing
- [ ] Resource challenge basic functionality
- [ ] Trash can spawning (empty tile detection)
- [ ] Point system accuracy
- [ ] Kitchen Sink multi-condition tracking
- [ ] Kitchen Sink UI (multiple progress bars)
- [ ] Save/load with new challenge types

---

## Phase 9: Release New Challenges üöÄ
**Target:** v2.0.0 - Feature expansion release

### Release Checklist
- [ ] Resource Challenge tested and stable
- [ ] Kitchen Sink Challenge tested and stable
- [ ] Updated documentation
- [ ] Steam Workshop update
- [ ] Changelog published

---

## Phase 10: PZ Tycoon Version 1 üí∞
**Goal**: Money-based chunk unlocking system

### Core Concept
Buy chunks with in-game money instead of completing challenges.

### Features
**Pricing System:**
- Chunk price = zombie population √ó multiplier
- Base price: ~$16 per zombie (1993 Kentucky land values)
- Scaling: Higher population = higher price
- Example: 100 zombies in chunk = $1,600 to unlock

**Economy Integration:**
- Use vanilla trading system values
- Item selling for money
- Price fluctuations (optional)
- Bulk purchase discounts (unlock multiple chunks)

**Configuration:**
- Price multiplier (Sandbox option)
- Base price per zombie
- Enable/disable price scaling
- Discount thresholds

### Technical Considerations
- Money tracking (player:getMoney())
- Transaction system (deduct money, unlock chunk)
- Price calculation based on zombie count
- UI showing chunk prices before purchase
- "Shop" menu for chunk purchases

### Testing
- [ ] Money deduction works correctly
- [ ] Chunk prices calculated accurately
- [ ] Price scaling functions properly
- [ ] Save/load preserves purchases
- [ ] Economy balance testing

---

## Phase 11: PZ Tycoon Version 2 üè™ (LONG SHOT)
**Goal**: NPC vendor system for chunk unlocking

**Note:** Will likely work on **Nutrition Tweak** mod before this phase.

### Core Concept
Vendor NPCs that need to be fed and protected to buy chunk unlocks.

### Features
**NPC Vendors:**
- Spawn at designated location
- Require food to stay alive
- Can be killed (challenge fails if all die)
- Sell chunk unlocks for money

**NPC Behavior:**
- Hunger system (must be fed regularly)
- Health system (can be attacked by zombies)
- Death handling (respawn after milestone?)
- Trading interface (buy chunks)

**Milestone System:**
- Respawn vendor after X chunks unlocked
- Multiple vendors possible
- Vendor upgrades (better prices, bulk deals)

### Technical Considerations
- Use NPCs from existing mods as reference:
  - Bandits mod
  - Day One mod
  - Week One mod
- NPC AI integration
- Food consumption mechanics
- Death/respawn logic
- Trading UI adaptation

### Challenges
- High complexity (NPC AI)
- Balance issues (keeping NPCs alive)
- Multiplayer implications
- Performance with multiple NPCs

---

## Phase 12: Multiplayer Support (IF READY) üë•
**Goal**: Full multiplayer compatibility

**Note:** May only implement for all challenges MINUS PZ Tycoon variants

### Requirements
- [ ] Server-side state synchronization
- [ ] Per-player challenge tracking (already character-specific!)
- [ ] Shared vs separate chunk unlocking decision
- [ ] Multiplayer testing
- [ ] Admin commands
- [ ] Server configuration options

### Testing Needed
- [ ] 2-player testing
- [ ] 4+ player testing
- [ ] Server restart recovery
- [ ] Player join/leave handling
- [ ] Chunk state sync accuracy
- [ ] Performance with multiple active challenges

### Implementation Approach
**Option A: Shared Chunks**
- All players work together on same chunks
- Kills/time/resources pool together
- Faster progression, cooperative gameplay

**Option B: Separate Chunks**
- Each player has own chunk progression
- Independent challenges
- Slower progression, individual gameplay

**Option C: Hybrid**
- Sandbox option to choose mode
- Server admin decides

---

## Spawner System (Ongoing Improvements) üßü
**Goal**: Intelligent zombie spawning with minimal frustration

### Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] Basic zombie spawner (spawns outside chunk)
- [x] Sound wave system (attracts zombies)
- [x] Stuck detection (non-approaching waves counter)
- [x] Backup spawn when zombie stuck (10 waves)
- [x] Directional spawn tracking (prevents repeated stuck directions)
- [x] Attack detection (zombie attacking structure vs approaching player)
- [x] Spawn delay system (30-min cooldown after chunk entry)
- [x] HUD debug info (closest zombie, spawn stats, stuck tracking)

### Planned Improvements üéØ
- [ ] **Dynamic Spawn Distance** (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY)
  - [ ] Start spawning zombies FAR from chunk (e.g., 100+ tiles)
  - [ ] Only move spawn point CLOSER if zombie gets stuck
  - [ ] Gradually reduce distance on each stuck spawn (100 ‚Üí 90 ‚Üí 80 ‚Üí ...)
  - [ ] Minimum distance threshold (never closer than 30 tiles)
  - [ ] Reset to far distance when entering new chunk
  - [ ] Benefits: Makes early chunks feel safer, only spawns close when needed
- [ ] Improved pathfinding check before spawn
- [ ] Structure destruction tracking (health monitoring)
- [ ] Functionally indestructible structure detection (1 hour no damage)
- [ ] Smart spawn location selection (avoid known stuck spots)

---

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### High Priority üî¥
- [ ] Remove reward system code (currently has errors)
- [ ] Implement dynamic spawn distance system

### Medium Priority üü°
- [ ] Further OnTick optimization (reduce check frequency where possible)
- [ ] Marker count optimization for large chunk counts
- [ ] Save file size monitoring (test with 50+ chunks)
- [ ] Long session testing (8+ hours)

### Low Priority üü¢
- [ ] Code style consistency pass
- [ ] Additional inline documentation
- [ ] Function naming review

### Build 42 Compatibility ‚úÖ
- [x] Replaced deprecated `getPerks()` with XP system
- [x] Tested teleportation method (Build 42 pattern)
- [x] Verified all API calls work in Build 42

---

## Performance Metrics

### Current Status ‚úÖ
- OnTick handlers: 3 active (boundary check, time tracking, skill tracking)
- Marker count: ~200-400 per character (depends on unlocked chunks)
- Memory usage: Unknown (needs testing)
- Save file size: Unknown (needs testing)

### Targets
- OnTick handlers: < 5 active simultaneously
- Marker count: < 500 visible at once
- Memory usage: < 100MB for mod
- Save file size: < 200KB per player (50+ chunks)

## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Character-specific data**: Prevents conflicts in multiplayer, allows per-player progression
- **ModData persistence**: Reliable save system, automatic with player saves
- **Named event handlers**: Allows proper removal, prevents memory leaks
- **Flag-based unlock system** (ZtH): Single source of truth, prevents timer bypasses
- **Chunk scanning** (blue expansion): Prevents stuck situations, scales well

### Lessons Learned
- Build 42 API changes require XP system instead of getPerks()
- Teleportation needs setLastX/Y/Z for stability
- Visual markers need character-specific storage for multiplayer
- Timer-based checks should use counters to reduce OnTick load
- Chunk mode requires careful boundary calculation for non-square layouts
- Reward system adds complexity without improving core gameplay loop

### Future Considerations
- Chunk size flexibility (currently hardcoded to boundarySize)
- Diagonal chunk unlocking (currently cardinal only)
- Chunk difficulty scaling formula
- Save file compression for large chunk counts
- Integration with base game progression systems
- Challenge menu UI (better than Sandbox for selection)
