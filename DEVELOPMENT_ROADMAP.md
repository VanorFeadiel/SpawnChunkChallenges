- [ ] **Skill Challenge** - Reach skill levels
- [ ] **Combo Challenge** - Multiple requirements

### Implementation

- [ ] Challenge-specific UI
- [ ] Challenge-specific rewards
- [ ] Random challenge generator

---

## Phase 5: Multiplayer Support
**Goal**: Full multiplayer compatibility

### Requirements

- [ ] Per-player challenge tracking
- [ ] Shared chunk unlocking (or separate?)
- [ ] Multiplayer testing
- [ ] Admin commands
- [ ] Server configuration options

### Testing

## Future Mod: PZ Tycoon Mode
**Separate mod using same chunk system**

### Core Concept
Buy chunks with in-game money instead of killing zombies.

### Pricing System
- Chunk price = zombie population Ã— multiplier
- Base price: ~$16 (1993 Kentucky land values)
- Scaling: Higher population = higher price

### Economy
- Trading system integration
- Item selling values
- Price fluctuations
- Bulk purchase discounts

---

## Technical Debt Tracking

### High Priority
- Victory function override (Visual.lua line 109)
- Event handler removal patterns
- Missing respawn handler

### Medium Priority
- Consolidate initialization timers
- ModData structure optimization
- Error handling improvements

### Low Priority
- Code style consistency
- Comment improvements
- Function naming conventions

---

## Performance Targets

- OnTick handlers: < 3 active simultaneously
- Marker count: < 200 visible at once
- Memory usage: < 50MB for mod
- Save file size: < 100KB per player
