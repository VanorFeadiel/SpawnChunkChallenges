# SpawnChunk Challenges

## Description
Project Zomboid mod that traps players in chunks area until they accomplish certain conditions to leave their chunk based on the selected challenges and options. This creates a progressive challenge system where players must complete various objectives to unlock new areas.

## Future Vision
This mod is designed with an additive approach where only one chunk is unlocked at a time. Players progressively unlock chunks based on completing different types of challenges, creating a structured progression system.

## Features
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Players are teleported back to spawn if they try to leave the 50x50 tile area
- **Dynamic Kill Target**: Kill requirement based on local zombie population (minimum 10)
- **Visual Feedback**: Ground markers, map symbols, and HUD display
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time kill counter and boundary distance warnings
- **Rewards**: Items awarded upon completion of the challenge
- **Persistence**: Progress saves across game sessions
